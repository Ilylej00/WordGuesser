# WordGuesser
A word guesser game I made with and for my partner Billy, written in python.

# How to use
This game expects a csv called "words.csv" containing a single column of all your words you wish
to be in the game. The words can be of any length but currently the words longer than 5 characters
are filtered out of play, this might change.
